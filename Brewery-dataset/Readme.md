# **Beer Production Analysis**

## Objective

In this case study you’ll be learning Exploratory Data Analytics (EDA) with the help of a dataset on beer production statistics in the US. This will enable you to understand why EDA is an important step in the process of Machine Learning.

## Tasks

You need to perform the following steps for successfully completing this assignment.
1. Data Loading
2. Data Cleaning
3. Exploratory Analysis: Bivariate and Multivariate
4. Creating Visualisations to Support the Analysis
5. Deriving Insights and Stating Conclusions

## Data Understanding

The data comes from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of USA(TTB). You can find the source to the repository containing the data here: [Beer Production GitHub](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-03-31)

<br>
The dataset contains three tables, in which you can find these details:

* `beer_states.csv` State-level beer production by year (2008-2019)
* `brewer_size.csv` Number of brewers by production size by year (2008-2019)
* `brewing_materials.csv` Monthly beer stats aggregated across the US (2008-2017)


Some considerations:
* A barrel of beer for this data is 31 gallons
* Removals = "Total barrels removed subject to tax by the breweries comprising the named strata of data", essentially how much was produced and removed for consumption.
